# Issues

I greatly appreciate issues being filed for bug reports, feature requests,
documentation problems, etc. Issues are the most valuable form of contribution.

# Discussions

Questions and general discussions should use the Discussions feature.

# Pull requests

I do not accept pull requests. If you've found a problem, please file an issue
instead of trying to fix it. Similarly, if you'd like a feature to be added,
file an issue requesting the feature. The timing and manner of a feature's
implementation are ultimately determined by my priorities and vision for the
project, but user input is taken into consideration.

## Why not?

While pull requests are meant as well-intentioned gifts of one's time, they
usually cause more work and stress than if I'd written the code myself, for a
multitude of reasons:

- Reviewing code is harder than writing it. Code review requires the same
  research and thought that writing code does, but it also requires finding
  wrong assumptions, oversights, etc.

- Most PRs cannot be merged as is. I strive for a high degree of code quality,
  and even minor problems with a PR will lead to at least one round of review
  and fixes.

- Pull requests don't fit my process. I like to focus on one project and
  specific issues for extended periods of time. This precludes the context
  switching necessary for responsive handling of PRs.

- A lot of PRs are drive-by PRs that never receive any attention after the first
  round of review. This is both frustrating and a waste of time.
  
- Having to review (and sometimes reject) PRs doesn't fit my personality.
  Providing negative feedback in a way that is not discouraging is difficult for
  me. Rejecting PRs makes me feel guilty. The fear of missing something in a
  review paralyzes me. Going back and forth over minor but important-to-me
  details makes me self-conscious. Instead of dealing with these feelings, I
  will instead avoid dealing with PRs for as long as possible, leading to
  frustration for all parties involved. Ultimately, most PRs require a certain
  level of mentorship, and I am not a mentor.
  
- Most code contributions are one-offs, transferring the burden of
  maintainership to the project owner. In the best case, this burden is no worse
  than if I'd written the code myself. In the worst case, a change was accepted
  begrudgingly so as not to offend the author and is now causing an additional
  burden.

Finally, I consider my projects to be works of craftsmanship, making them deeply
personal things. Accepting code contributions would feel akin to letting someone
take a chip out of a work-in-progress wooden chair, or letting someone add to
your painting.
